# whoami
A repo that contains information about who I am.

Additionally, each of the following steps occurs:
- [x] Every commit is automatically turned into a release in both a `yaml` and `json` format, for use elsewhere
- [ ] Every commit updates my [GitHub README](https://github.com/timothy-gonzalez/timothy-gonzalez)
- [ ] Every commit updates my LinkedIn profile to contain my newest projects
